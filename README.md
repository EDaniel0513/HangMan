# HangMan
Virtual hangman made by three Chantilly High School students (based in NoVA).
Abhinaya K, Arjun M and Emile D worked on hangman from April 3rd to April 7th 2020.

Make sure you are signed in and then download the .zip file. Extract as per usual.
To access the game, open the index.html file in your chrome browser (may have to copy paste URL from the internet explorer tab that opens).

Clicking the "Start Game" button should prompt the user; from there the user follows the given directions.

After finishing a round, user will be shown either a winning or losing screen. From there, user can play again from the display by clicking on "Play Again?". It does not appear as a button, but acts as one.
